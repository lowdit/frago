Check that\n    *   a role is rendered (e.g. button, edit zone, link);\n    *   the role rendered is relevant to the associated functionality (for example, a component that triggers the opening of a modal window and is rendered as a \"edit zone\" has an irrelevant role; it should be identified as a button);\n    *   a name is rendered and that this name is relevant, i.e. that it enables the function of the element to be understood (for form fields, please refer to the \"Forms\" theme for an assessment);\n    *   if the component has a visible label (a visible text), the text is rendered;\n    *   if the component has a perceptible state (activated, deactivated, selected), this state is rendered;\n    *   if the component can change state (e.g. toggle button, slider), perform the necessary actions to test the different states and check that each change of state is correctly rendered (switching to the selected state, increasing the slider);\n    *   if the component has a perceptible value (value of a slider), this value is rendered.\n5.  If this is the case, the criterion is validated.\n###### iOS With **Accessibility Inspector**\n1.  Connect the iOS mobile device to the computer running macOS.\n2.  Activate the **Accessibility Inspector** software.\n3.  Choose the mobile device as the source and stay on the \"Inspection\" tab (buttons at top right).\n4.  Use the arrows in Accessibility Inspector to access each element of the interface.\n5.  Check that\n    *   a role is available in the \"Traits\" parameter (for example, Button, Tab, Text Field);\n    *   the role is relevant to the associated functionality (for example, a component which triggers the opening of a modal window and which is presented as Static text has an irrelevant role; it should be identified as a button);\n    *   a name is available in the \"Label\" parameter and that this name is relevant, i.e. that it allows the function of the element to be understood (for form fields, please refer to the \"Forms\" theme for an assessment);\n    *   if the component has a visible name (a visible text), the label defined in the \"Label\" parameter contains at least this label.\n6.  If the component has a perceptible state (activated, deactivated, selected), check that this state\n    *   is available in the \"Traits\" parameter;\n    *   or is indicated in the \"Label\" parameter.\n7.  If the component can change state (e.g. toggle button, slider), perform the necessary actions to test the different states and check that each change of state (switching to the selected state, increasing the slider)\n    *   is available in the \"Traits\" parameter;\n    *   or is indicated in the \"Label\" parameter.\n8.  If this is the case, the criterion is validated.\n###### iOS With voice control\nThe voice control application allows users to navigate by voice.\nCriterion 5.1 in its entirety cannot be assessed with voice control, but one voice control feature (the display of labels) provides a quick overview of the status of interactive components.\nVoice control will enable us to detect the components that can be used by touch but are not interactive components detectable by assistive technologies, the presence of a label and its relevance, and the presence of the visible label in the accessible label.\n1.  Activate voice control: Settings > Accessibility > Voice control.\n2.  Display the accessible names of interactive components: from the voice control settings screen, go to the \"Overlay\" button and activate it, then choose \"Element names\".\n3.  From now on, when voice control is activated, grey tooltips will appear above interactive elements that have labels. Note that if the screen has a very large number of interactive controls, the labels will be displayed in successive groups (one group of labels disappears and another appears).\nWhat you need to know: only elements with interactive roles recognised by the Accessibility API will have a label. This will allow you to quickly identify which elements that can be used by touch are not recognised by the voice control and are therefore not interactive elements (which constitutes non-compliance).\nProcedure:\n1.  Identify all the interactive controls (that can be activated by touch) on the screen.\n2.  Activate the voice control and check that all the interactive controls identified have an associated label (grey tooltip).\n3.  If so, check that\n    *   the associated label is relevant;\n    *   and the visible name (if it has one) is included in this label.\n4.  If this is the case, the conditions regarding the relevance of the label and the presence of the visible name in the accessible name are met.\n###### Android\n1.  Activate the **screen reader**.\n2.  Identify the interactive components on the screen (e.g. button, link).\n3.  Access each interactive component using the screen reader gestures.\n4.  Check that\n    *   a role is rendered (e.g. button, edit zone, link);\n    *   the role rendered is relevant to the associated functionality (for example, a component that triggers the opening of a modal window and is rendered as a \"edit zone\" has an irrelevant role; it should be identified as a button);\n    *   a name is rendered and that this name is relevant, i.e. that it allows the function of the element to be understood (for form fields, please refer to the [\"Forms\"](#topic-9) theme to evaluate them);\n    *   if the component has a visible name (a visible text), the label is rendered;\n    *   if the component has a perceptible state (activated, deactivated, selected), this state is rendered;\n    *   if the component can change state (e.g. toggle button, slider), perform the necessary actions to test the different states and check that each change of state is correctly rendered (switching to the selected state, increasing the slider);\n    *   that if the component has a perceptible value (value of a slider), this value is rendered.\n5.  If this is the case, the criterion is validated.",
  "5.2": "The aim here is to ensure that the component can be used by the screen reader, voice control, an external keyboard or any other external switch. The tests can be limited to a few pointing devices since the characteristics required (on interactive components) are similar.\nIt is nevertheless necessary to test at least with the screen reader and an external keyboard.\nFor the external keyboard, [some settings are necessary for the device to be fully functional](methodologie.md#external-keyboard).\n###### iOS and Android\n1.  Activate the **screen reader**.\n2.  Browse all the interactive components.\n3.  For each interactive component, check that\n    *   it can be reached with the screen reader;\n    *   it can be activated with the screen reader.\n4.

  "15.2": "###### iOS and Android\n1.  Check that the application allows two-way voice communication.\n2.  If it does, check that there is a real-time text function (it may sometimes be necessary to activate a dedicated parameter in the application to enable real-time text).\n3.  If not, check whether the application can connect to a terminal with real-time text functionality (this may be difficult to assess without a real-time communication terminal or if the network used by the terminal does not support real-time text protocols. A first step may be to search the documentation or ask the application publisher directly)\n4.  If this is the case, the criterion is validated.",
  "15.3": "###### iOS and Android\n1.  Check that the application allows two-way voice communication.\n2.  If it does, check that it has a real-time text (RTT) function.\n3.  If this is the case, check that it is possible to use both modes of communication at the same time, i.e. users can send RTT messages at the same time as other users are speaking, for example.\n4.  If this is the case, the criterion is validated.",
  "15.4": "###### iOS and Android\n1.  Activate the application and the application's RTT functionality on two terminals and connect them to the same session.\n2.  Send a text message from both terminals to obtain messages with different statuses (sent and received).\n3.  Check that\n    *   sent and received messages are visually separated (for example, sent messages are in one window and received messages in another, or there is a line break between each received and sent message if they are presented in the same window);\n    *   it is visually possible to distinguish between messages sent and messages received (for example, the words \"Sent\" near a message sent or \"Received\" near a message received);\n    *   if the interlocutor is identified for oral communication (for example, the avatar of the person speaking), that the authors of written messages are also identified (for example, the presence of a name or an identifier preceding the message).\n4.  Activate the **screen reader** and navigate through the messages.\n5.  Check that the screen reader displays\n    *   the sent or received status of each message;\n    *   identification of the author of the message.\n6.  If this is the case, the criterion is validated.",
  "15.5": "###### iOS and Android\n1.  Check that the application allows two-way voice communication and RTT communication or real-time video broadcasting.\n2.  If this is the case, activate the application on two terminals and connect them to the same session.\n3.  Have a user speak from one of the terminals.\n4.  Check that a visual indicator appears on the interface to identify that a person is speaking. It is not necessary for this criterion to identify who is speaking, but simply to identify that there is a person speaking. For example, a halo around or an icon near the avatar of the person speaking.\n5.  If this is the case, the criterion is validated.",
  "15.6": "###### iOS and Android\nNo evaluation method is proposed for this criterion.\n**Important note:** This criterion is very complex to assess and requires a certain mastery of all interoperability concepts and standards. If the application you are assessing or developing needs to cover this criterion, we refer you to the full text of criterion 6.2.3 Interoperability in the EN 301 549 standard.",
  "15.7": "###### iOS and Android\n1.  Check that the application supports real-time text (RTT) communication.\n2.  If so, activate the application and the written communication functionality on two separate terminals and connect them to the same session.\n3.  Enter text on the first terminal and observe its appearance on the second terminal. The appearance on the second terminal must be instantaneous (less than half a second). Depending on how the functionality works, each character is not sent individually. In fact, if the RTT communication functionality implements word prediction, it is when the desired word is selected that it is sent, not when the first characters used to trigger the suggestion display are entered. A simple observation test may be sufficient to observe the instantaneous appearance on the terminal receiving the written message.\n4.  If this is the case, the criterion is validated.",
  "15.8": "###### iOS and Android\n1.  Activate the **screen reader** from a terminal.\n2.  From a second terminal, make a call to the first terminal.\n3.  When the incoming call appears, check\n    *   that the caller identification is available in visible text format (for example, a name or a telephone number);\n    *   and that this identification is correctly rendered by **the screen reader**.\n4.  If this is the case, the criterion is validated.",
  "15.9": "###### iOS and Android\n1.  Activate the application and launch a video call between the two terminals.\n2.  Check that the terminal receiving the call has a method enabling sign language users to identify the caller.\n3.  If this is the case, the criterion is validated.",
  "15.10": "###### iOS and Android\n1.  Identify the features available (apart from the oral communication feature) that are based on listening to information or issuing commands, for example\n    *   voicemail;\n    *   an automatic switchboard (e.g. one that requires you to say a number between 1 and 4 to be redirected to a service);\n    *   or any other interactive voice server.\n2.  Check:\n    *   that the information is available without having to listen or speak;\n    *   that the actions can be carried out without having to listen or speak, or that there is an alternative to the functionality that can be used without having to listen or speak.\n3.  If this is the case, the criterion is validated.",
  "15.11": "###### iOS and Android\nFor conditions relating to resolution and frame rate, the safest way to assess this criterion is to search either the interface or the application's documentation for this information. It is also advisable to ask the application's publisher to provide these technical details.\nFor the last condition concerning the time lag between video and audio, the test can be established by simple observation:\n1.  Activate the application on two devices.\n2.  Establish a video call connection between the two devices.\n3.  Check that speech and video are synchronised (lip-sync, lip movement).\n4.  If this is the case, the criterion is validated."
